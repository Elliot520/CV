00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,960
a time of scientific and mathematical

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,400
innovation

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,000
magic and fertile land irrigated by the

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,480
great

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,160
nile river ancient egypt

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,400
was a successful and intelligent

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,080
civilization that lasted

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,760
for 3 000 years

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,400
what do you think your life would be

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,720
like if you were an egyptian during this

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,240
time period

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,360
and let's pretend it's a good period no

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,680
locusts plagues or famine for you

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,280
what kind of food would you eat how were

women treated and

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,399
did slaves build the pyramids

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,039
this is what if and here's what would

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:51,600
happen

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,840
if you lived in ancient egypt

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,480
ancient egyptians believed in strict

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,879
social structures

24
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,120
depending on the class or trade you were

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,080
born into

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,280
your life would be vastly different

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,360
the hierarchical pyramid of social

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,119
status and wealth

29
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,880
was composed of slaves and servants

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,240
tenant farmers specialists like sailors

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,759
soldiers educational professionals

32
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,520
and finally the elite

33
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,439
who would you be at the bottom of the

34
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,400
social pyramid

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,439
were slaves they came from foreign lands

36
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,000
but

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,040
were not of a single race and

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,840
while they could negotiate their

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,720
contracts they were still

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,360
bonded laborers and worked in exchange

41
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,320
for food and shelter

42
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,399
at the very top of the pyramid was the

43
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,200
ruler who reigned over everyone

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,840
there were 300 rulers throughout ancient

45
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,680
egypt's existence

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,399
while we call them pharaohs today that

47
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,119
wasn't their

48
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,800
actual title in ancient egypt

49
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,520
[Music]

50
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,240
rulers did not necessarily have to be

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,960
men

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,160
or egyptian but they were seen as divine

53
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,080
liaisons between the gods

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,599
and the people life

55
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,840
would be drastically different depending

56
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,520
on your gender

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,319
like many ancient civilizations egypt

58
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,280
had strict

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,120
gender roles but you still had the same

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,239
legal rights

61
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,800
women could own property and live alone

62
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,000
if they chose to

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,959
however marriage was seen as a social

64
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:35,280
and

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,080
economic necessity no matter your gender

66
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,400
so

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,280
if you lived in ancient egypt you'd

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,519
probably be married and have a brood of

69
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,920
children

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,160
you would live in a house built of mud

71
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,080
bricks with a stone oven

72
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,480
and pits dug into the ground for food

73
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,879
storage

74
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,239
if you were an elite family then lucky

75
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,120
you

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,599
as a nobleman or woman you would be

77
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,800
waited upon by your servants

78
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,519
after a breakfast of bread and fruit the

79
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,840
man of the house would take his chariot

80
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,680
down to his estate on the banks of the

81
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,519
nile

82
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,760
after touring the grounds and maybe

83
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,840
meeting with the estate overseer about

84
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,120
the year's harvest

85
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,400
you might take a quick nap

86
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,080
once you're rested you would meet up

87
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,319
with a friend to hunt wildfowl on your

88
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:26,930
estate

89
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,080
[Music]

90
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,560
at home as a woman you would spend the

91
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,000
day supervising plans

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,920
for a banquet before the banquet begins

93
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,159
you would adorn yourself with gold and

94
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,760
semi-precious stones to

95
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,440
further show your wealthy status

96
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,319
now you're ready to greet your guests as

97
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,760
they arrive in chariots

98
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,080
and litters which were wheel-less

99
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,120
enclosures

100
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,080
carried on the shoulders of servants

101
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,920
nobleman or woman

102
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,360
you feast on geese duck fish ox and

103
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,480
gazelle

104
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,879
followed by grapes figs dates and melons

105
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,040
once the party is over you head to bed

106
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,480
while your servants clean up

107
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,040
life as a farmer is not nearly as grand

108
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,120
if you're a man you spend the day

109
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,639
working in the fields and

110
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,320
tending to cattle or ducks

111
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,600
on tax day you would pack up some of

112
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,720
your harvest and

113
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,800
bring it to the temple as payment for

114
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,320
the land

115
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,400
if you're a woman you spend the day

116
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,600
grinding wheat

117
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,520
making bread and raising children

118
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,199
for food you mainly eat bread beer

119
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,919
garlic and if you're fortunate a little

120
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,560
bit of meat

121
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,120
maybe you're neither part of the elite

122
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,400
or a farmer but

123
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,600
a pyramid builder

124
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,479
you wouldn't be a slave but you would

125
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,840
live a life of hard labor

126
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,880
you would be one of 10 000 devoted

127
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,280
workers

128
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,479
since it took 30 years to build one

129
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,600
pyramid

130
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,680
you would probably work on the same

131
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,520
monument for your entire life

132
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,800
which would be shorter than your fellow

133
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,479
ancient egyptians because of

134
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,080
all that hard labor at least you get to

135
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,479
eat

136
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,039
meat regularly and get an honorable

137
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,080
burial once you die

138
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,039
no matter your status you would worship

139
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,320
several thousand

140
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,120
gods and for fun you would play board

141
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,600
games

142
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,479
such as men or senate to pass some free

143
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,800
time

144
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,479
overall the quality of your life would

145
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,919
drastically depend

146
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,520
on your ruler and the time period

147
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,240
there were three periods of prosperity

148
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,440
and two periods of

149
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,440
instability during this civilization

150
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,919
fear of famine caused by droughts or

151
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,039
locusts was

152
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,319
a constant threat but

153
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,800
you'd still have better luck living a

154
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,960
good life in ancient egypt than you

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,470
would in the middle ages

156
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,319
[Music]

157
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,560
very few people fared well in those

158
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,880
diseased and poverty-ridden times

159
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,479
but that's a story for another
